# Employee Portal - Privacy Updates

## Overview

Updated the employee portal to hide all risk monitoring information from employees. This ensures employees are not aware of the security monitoring system while their activities are still being tracked and analyzed in the background.

   - `ActiveThreat` records created for failed logins
   - Real-time alerts sent to Security Dashboard

2. **File Downloads:**

   - All downloads logged in `BulkDownloadAlert` collection
   - File size analyzed by rule engine:
     - <100MB: Low risk (0-10 points)
     - 100-999MB: Medium risk (25-30 points)
     - ‚â•1GB: High risk (40+ points)
   - `ActiveThreat` created for files ‚â•200MB
