# Vigilant Guard - Demo Presentation Guide

## Quick Reference for Judge Presentation

---

## üéØ 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"Vigilant Guard is an **AI-powered Insider Threat Detection System** that monitors employee activities in real-time to prevent data theft. It detects suspicious patterns like failed login attempts, unusual file downloads, and impossible geographic locations‚Äîalerting security teams instantly before damage occurs."

---

## üì± Live Demo Script (5 Minutes)

### Part 1: Show the Problem (1 min)

**Say**: "Companies face a major security risk from insider threats‚Äîemployees who intentionally or accidentally leak sensitive data. Traditional systems only detect breaches after they happen. Vigilant Guard prevents them before data leaves the company."

### Part 2: Security Dashboard (2 min)

**Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3000`

**Show**:

1. **Stats Cards** - "Real-time metrics: 5 active users, 3 threats detected"
2. **Threat Trends** - "Visual graph showing threat patterns over time"
3. **High-Risk Employees** - "Employees with most suspicious activity"
4. **Alert Distribution** - "Pie chart of threat types"

**Say**: "The security dashboard gives administrators a complete overview. Every metric updates in real-time through WebSocket connections."

### Part 3: Threat Detection Demo (2 min)

**Navigate to**: Employee Portal (`http://localhost:3001`)

**Demonstrate**:

1. **Failed Login Detection**

   - Try wrong password 3 times with EMP001
   - Switch to Security Dashboard
   - Show new threat appearing instantly

   **Say**: "Watch - after 3 failed attempts, a threat alert appears automatically. The system detected this as potential brute-force attack."

2. **File Download Monitoring**

   - Login successfully
   - Download "Confidential_Client_Data.csv"
   - Switch to dashboard
   - Show bulk download alert

   **Say**: "When employees download sensitive files, the system analyzes the behavior. Large or confidential files trigger alerts for investigation."

3. **Active Threats Investigation**

   - Navigate to Active Threats page
   - Click on a threat card
   - Show details and risk score

   **Say**: "Security teams can investigate each threat, see all details, and mark as resolved or escalate."

## üîë Key Features to Highlight

### 1. **Real-Time Detection** ‚ö°

- Instant alerts via WebSocket
- No delays between event and notification
- Dashboard auto-updates every 30 seconds

**Demo**: Show how threats appear without page refresh

### 2. **Intelligent Risk Scoring** üß†

- Calculates risk based on multiple factors
- Categorizes as Low/Medium/High
- Updates dynamically as behavior escalates

**Demo**: Show how 3 failed logins = Medium, 5 failed = High

### 3. **Multiple Threat Types** üéØ

- **Login Anomalies**: Failed attempts, unusual hours
- **Geographic Anomalies**: Impossible travel, new locations
- **Bulk Downloads**: Large files, multiple downloads

**Demo**: Point to Alert Distribution chart

### 4. **Pattern Analysis** üìä

- Learns normal employee behavior
- Detects deviations from baseline
- Considers time, location, file types

**Demo**: Show employee pattern data in database

### 5. **Dual Portal System** üë•

- Security Dashboard for admins
- Employee Portal for normal access
- Monitoring is invisible to employees

**Demo**: Switch between both portals

## üéì Judge Q&A Preparation

### Q: "How does it detect threats?"

**A**: "We use a rule-based engine with configurable thresholds. For example, 2 failed logins = 30 risk points (Medium), 5 failed logins = 70 points (High). Geographic anomalies calculate travel time between locations‚Äîif someone logs in from London and New York 2 hours apart (physically impossible), it triggers a High alert."

### Q: "What makes this better than existing solutions?"

**A**: "Three things: 1) Real-time detection through WebSocket, not batch processing. 2) Behavioral analysis, not just rule-based. 3) User-friendly dashboard that's actually usable by security teams, not just raw logs."

### Q: "Can it detect zero-day attacks?"

**A**: "It detects behavioral anomalies, so yes‚Äîif an attack causes unusual file downloads or login patterns, it will trigger alerts even if the attack method is new."

### Q: "How do you handle false positives?"

**A**: "Security admins can mark threats as resolved. We also use graduated risk levels‚Äînot everything triggers an alert. For example, 1 failed login doesn't alert, but 3 does. This reduces noise while catching real threats."

### Q: "Is it scalable?"

**A**: "Yes‚ÄîMongoDB Atlas handles millions of records, Node.js is event-driven for high concurrency, and the microservices architecture allows independent scaling of components."

### Q: "What about employee privacy?"

**A**: "We only monitor work-related activities (logins, file access) during work hours. No personal data or content is captured‚Äîjust metadata like timestamps and file names. Employees are informed of monitoring."

### Q: "How long did this take to build?"

**A**: "The core system was developed over [X weeks/months], including design, implementation, testing, and documentation. The real-time monitoring and threat detection engine were the most complex components."
