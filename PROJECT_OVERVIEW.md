# Vigilant Guard - Insider Threat Detection System

## Comprehensive Project Overview

---

## 1. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Vigilant Guard** is a sophisticated insider threat detection system designed to monitor employee activities and identify potential security risks within an organization. The system operates covertly, tracking user behaviors without alerting employees to the monitoring, while providing security teams with real-time alerts and comprehensive analytics.

### Core Purpose

## 4. THREAT DETECTION SYSTEM

### Risk Scoring Engine

The system uses a sophisticated algorithm to calculate risk scores (0-100) based on multiple factors:

#### Login-Based Threats

- **Low Risk (Score < 25)**

  - Successful login from usual location
  - Normal working hours
  - Expected behavior patterns

- **Medium Risk (Score 25-49)**

  - 2-3 failed login attempts
  - Login from new location
  - Unusual access time

- **High Risk (Score 50+)**

  - 3-5 failed login attempts
  - Multiple geographic anomalies
  - Suspicious timing patterns

- **Critical Risk (Score 70+)**
  - 5+ failed login attempts
  - Concurrent sessions from different locations
  - Brute force attack patterns

#### Download-Based Threats

- **File Size Analysis**

  - Small files (<100MB): Low risk
  - Medium files (100-999MB): Medium risk
  - Large files (1GB+): High risk
  - Bulk downloads: Critical risk

- **File Sensitivity**
  - Public documents: Low risk
  - Internal files: Medium risk
  - Confidential data: High risk
  - Classified information: Critical risk

#### Geographic Anomalies

- Login from unexpected country
- Impossible travel (two logins from distant locations in short time)
- Login from high-risk geographic regions
- VPN/proxy usage detection

## 6. REAL-TIME EXAMPLE FLOW

### Scenario: Suspicious Employee Activity Detection

Let's follow employee "Sarah Chen" (EMP001) through a typical day that triggers security alerts:

---

#### **8:30 AM - Normal Login** âœ“

**What Happens:**

1. Sarah logs into the Employee Portal from her office in New York
2. System captures:
   - Employee Token: EMP001
   - IP Address: 192.168.1.45
   - Location: New York, United States
   - Time: 8:30 AM EST

**Backend Processing:**

- Creates `LoginActivity` record
- Compares with Sarah's typical pattern (she usually logs in between 8:00-9:00 AM)
- IP matches her office network
- Geographic location matches expected
- **Risk Score: 10 (Low Risk)**

**Security Dashboard:**

- "Active Users" count increases by 1
- New entry appears in Logs table
- No alert generated (normal behavior)

---

#### **10:15 AM - Small File Download** âœ“

**What Happens:**

1. Sarah downloads "Meeting_Notes_Q1.docx" (25MB)
2. A toast notification appears: "âœ“ Downloaded: Meeting_Notes_Q1.docx | File Size: 25 MB"

**Backend Processing:**

- Creates `BulkDownloadAlert` record
- File size: 25MB (Small)
- File type: Document (Medium sensitivity)
- Calculates risk: **Score: 15 (Low Risk)**
- No immediate threat detected

**Security Dashboard:**

- Download logged in system
- No alert created (within normal parameters)

---

#### **11:00 AM - Failed Login Attempt** âš 

**What Happens:**

1. Someone tries to log in as Sarah with wrong password
2. Location: Tokyo, Japan
3. Login fails

**Backend Processing:**

- Creates `LoginActivity` record with "Failed" status
- Detects geographic anomaly (New York â†’ Tokyo in 2.5 hours = impossible)
- Counts recent failed attempts: 1
- **Risk Score: 35 (Medium Risk)**

**System Action:**

- Creates `ActiveThreat` record
- Sends real-time WebSocket notification to security dashboard

**Security Dashboard:**

- **ALERT APPEARS**
- "Active Threats" count increases
- "Medium Risk" count increases
- Real-time notification: "New threat detected for EMP001"
- Threat details shown:
  - Employee: EMP001
  - Type: Login
  - Risk Level: Medium
  - Details: "Failed login from Tokyo, Japan"
  - Time: 11:00 AM

---

#### **11:05 AM - Second Failed Login** âš âš 

**What Happens:**

1. Another failed login attempt
2. Still from Tokyo, Japan
3. Wrong password again

**Backend Processing:**

- Creates another `LoginActivity` record
- Counts failed attempts in last 30 minutes: 2
- Geographic anomaly persists
- **Risk Score: 50 (Medium â†’ High threshold)**

**System Action:**

- Updates existing `ActiveThreat` record
- Escalates severity to High
- Sends updated WebSocket notification

**Security Dashboard:**

- **ALERT ESCALATES**
- Threat moves from "Medium Risk" to "High Risk"
- Alert panel shows: "2 failed login attempts from Tokyo, Japan"
- Security team can see both attempts in logs

---

#### **11:10 AM - Third Failed Login** ðŸš¨

**What Happens:**

1. Third consecutive failed attempt
2. Same location (Tokyo)

**Backend Processing:**

- Three failed attempts in 10 minutes
- Clear brute force pattern detected
- **Risk Score: 70 (High â†’ Critical)**

**System Action:**

- Escalates to Critical threat level
- High-priority WebSocket notification
- Could trigger email/SMS alerts (if configured)

**Security Dashboard:**

- **CRITICAL ALERT**
- Red highlighting in Active Threats table
- "Critical" badge displayed
- Suggested actions appear:
  - Lock account
  - Force password reset
  - Contact employee
  - Investigate immediately

**Security Team Response:**

1. Security analyst "John Smith" reviews the alert
2. Sees the geographic impossibility (NY â†’ Tokyo)
3. Checks if Sarah is actually in New York (she is)
4. Determines this is a breach attempt
5. Clicks "Mark as Solved" after:
   - Locking the account temporarily
   - Notifying Sarah
   - Forcing password reset

---

#### **1:30 PM - Large File Download** ðŸš¨

**What Happens:**

1. Sarah (now back in control) downloads "Backup_Database_Full.zip" (5GB)
2. Toast appears: "Downloaded: Backup_Database_Full.zip | 5 GB"

**Backend Processing:**

- Calculates risk factors:
  - Large file size: +40 points
  - Sensitive content: +30 points
  - Unusual for Sarah's role: +20 points
- **Risk Score: 90 (Critical Risk)**

**System Action:**

- Creates new `ActiveThreat` record

- **NEW CRITICAL ALERT**
- "Active Threats" count increases
- Details shown:
  - Employee: EMP001
  - Type: Bulk Download
  - File: Backup_Database_Full.zip
  - Size: 5GB
  - Risk: Critical
  - Anomalies: "File size exceeds normal patterns", "Sensitive data access"

**Security Team Response:**

1. Analyst reviews Sarah's download
2. Checks her role: "Marketing Manager" (shouldn't need database backups)
3. Calls Sarah to verify
4. Sarah explains: "IT department asked me to download for migration"
5. Analyst verifies with IT department
6. Marks threat as solved: "Authorized by IT team"

---

#### **5:30 PM - Normal Logout** âœ“

**What Happens:**

1. Sarah logs out from Employee Portal

**Backend Processing:**

- Updates `LoginActivity` record
- Sets `logout_timestamp`
- Calculates session duration: 9 hours
- Session appears normal

**Security Dashboard:**

- "Active Users" count decreases by 1
- Session logged as complete
