## 🔐 Geolocation Features

### **When Enabled (Recommended):**

- System tracks your primary location
- Creates verified location entry automatically
- Monitors future logins for suspicious locations
- Generates alerts for unusual access patterns

### **Strict Mode:**

- ✅ **When ON:** Only allows logins from verified IP ranges
- ❌ **When OFF:** Allows logins from anywhere (with risk alerts)

### **Example Configurations:**

**Standard Office Worker:**

```
Location: Office
Country: United States
City: New York
IP Range: 192.168.1.0/24
Verification: ON
Strict Mode: OFF
```

**Remote Worker:**

```
Location: Home
Country: United States
City: San Francisco
IP Range: 192.168.2.0/24
Verification: ON
Strict Mode: OFF
```

**High Security Employee:**

```
Location: Office
Country: United States
City: New York
IP Range: 192.168.1.0/24
Verification: ON
Strict Mode: ON  ← Blocks all unknown IPs
```

## 📊 Auto-Generated Employee Token

The system automatically generates unique employee tokens:

- Format: `EMP` + sequential number
- Example: `EMP001`, `EMP002`, `EMP003`, etc.
- Token is displayed after successful registration
- Use this token to login

---

## 🎯 User Flow

```
1. User visits http://localhost:3000
   ↓
2. Clicks "Create Account" button
   ↓
3. Fills registration form
   ↓
4. Submits form
   ↓
5. Backend creates:
   - Employee record in database
   - Hashed password
   - Verified location entry (if geo enabled)
   - Unique employee token
   ↓
6. Success! Shows employee token
   ↓
7. Auto-redirects to login (3 seconds)
   ↓
8. User logs in with generated token
```
