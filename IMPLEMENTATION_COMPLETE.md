# ✅ Implementation Complete - Employee Login & Risk Tracking System

## 🎉 What We Built

### 1. **Employee Authentication System**

- ✅ Added `password` field to EmployeePattern schema (bcrypt hashed, minimum 6 characters)
- ✅ Created `/api/employees/login` endpoint with password verification
- ✅ Created `/api/employees/register` endpoint for new employee registration
- ✅ Integrated bcryptjs for secure password hashing (10 salt rounds)

### 2. **Risk Tracking & Scoring**

The system now automatically tracks and calculates risk based on login attempts:

| Failed Attempts (30 min window) | Risk Score | Risk Level | Alert Created |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 0 (Successful login)            | 5          | Low        | Yes ✅        |
| 2 attempts                      | 30         | Low        | Yes ✅        |
| 3-4 attempts                    | 50         | Medium     | Yes ⚠️        |
| 5+ attempts                     | 70         | High       | Yes 🚨        |

### 3. **Real-Time Updates**

- ✅ All login attempts create ActiveThreat records
- ✅ Socket.IO emits threats to Security Dashboard in real-time
- ✅ Dashboard shows login anomalies with risk scores

### 4. **Data Storage**

Every login attempt is stored with:

- Employee token
- IP address
- Location (country, city, coordinates)
- Timestamp
- Success/failure status
- Failure reason (if failed)

### 5. **Test Data**

Created seed script with 4 test employees:

```
EMP001 - John Smith (password: password123)
EMP002 - Sarah Johnson (password: password123)
EMP003 - Michael Chen (password: password123)
EMP999 - Test User (password: password123)
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Seed Test Employees (if not done)

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed:employees
```

### Step 3: Start the Employee Portal

```bash
cd employee-portal
npm start
```

### Step 4: Open in Browser

- Employee Portal: http://localhost:3001
- Security Dashboard: http://localhost:3000

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Login (Low Risk)

1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Enter: EMP001 / password123
3. Click "Sign In"
4. ✅ **Expected**: Success message, risk level "Low", alert appears in dashboard

### Scenario 2: Failed Attempts (Medium Risk)

1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Enter: EMP002 / wrongpassword (3-4 times)
3. ⚠️ **Expected**: Error with attempt count, risk level "Medium", alerts in dashboard

### Scenario 3: Multiple Failed Attempts (High Risk)

1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Enter: EMP003 / wrongpassword (5+ times)
3. 🚨 **Expected**: Error with HIGH RISK warning, alerts with risk score 70 in dashboard

### Scenario 4: Success After Failures

1. Fail login 3 times with wrong password
2. Login with correct password
3. ✅ **Expected**: Success, but previous high-risk alerts remain in dashboard

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Database (MongoDB)

```javascript
// LoginActivity collection
db.loginactivities
  .find({ employee_token: "EMP001" })
  .sort({ login_timestamp: -1 });

// ActiveThreat collection
db.activethreats.find({ employee_token: "EMP001", alert_type: "login" });

// EmployeePattern collection
db.employeepatterns.find({ emp_token: "EMP001" });
```

### Check API Endpoints

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Login (successful)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/employees/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"employeeId":"EMP001","password":"password123"}'

# Login (failed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/employees/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"employeeId":"EMP001","password":"wrong"}'
```

## 📊 Dashboard Integration

The Security Dashboard automatically receives and displays:

- Login alerts in the Alerts Table
- Risk scores in the stats cards
- High-risk employees list
- Recent activity feed
- Threat trends chart

All updates happen in **real-time** via WebSocket connection!

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

1. **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with 10 salt rounds
2. **Failed Attempt Tracking**: 30-minute rolling window
3. **Risk Calculation**: Automatic based on failed attempts
4. **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate notification to security team
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete login history stored
6. **IP & Location Tracking**: Geographic data for each attempt
7. **Account Status**: Active/inactive status check

## 🎯 Key Achievements

✅ **Backend Complete**: All API endpoints working
✅ **Frontend Integrated**: Login form connected to real API
✅ **Database Schema**: Updated with password field
✅ **Risk Engine**: Automatic risk calculation
✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Socket.IO integration
✅ **Test Data**: Seed script with 4 test employees
✅ **Documentation**: Complete user guides

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

1. ✅ Fixed field name mismatch (`emp_token` vs `employee_token`)
2. ✅ Added missing bcryptjs dependency
3. ✅ Updated ActiveThreat model fields (`alert_type`, `original_alert_id`)
4. ✅ Fixed simulation routes to include password when creating employees
5. ✅ Added wrapper functions in ruleEngine for compatibility

## 📈 What Happens Next

When an employee logs in:

1. **Employee enters credentials** → Frontend validates input
2. **API call to /api/employees/login** → Backend receives request
3. **Database lookup** → Find employee by token
4. **Password verification** → bcrypt.compare()
5. **LoginActivity created** → Store login attempt
6. **Risk calculation** → Count recent failed attempts
7. **ActiveThreat created** → Based on risk level
8. **Socket.IO emit** → Send to dashboard
9. **Dashboard updates** → Real-time alert display

## 🎓 Lesson Learned

- **Schema consistency matters**: Field names must match across models
- **Required fields**: ActiveThreat needed `alert_type` and `original_alert_id`
- **Password security**: Always hash passwords, never store plain text
- **Real-time tracking**: Socket.IO makes monitoring seamless
- **Risk windows**: 30-minute rolling window for attempt counting

## ✨ Demo Flow

1. Open two browser tabs:

   - Tab 1: Employee Portal (localhost:3001)
   - Tab 2: Security Dashboard (localhost:3000)

2. In Tab 1: Try wrong password 5 times
3. In Tab 2: Watch HIGH RISK alerts appear in real-time
4. In Tab 1: Login with correct password
5. In Tab 2: See LOW RISK alert for successful login

**This demonstrates the entire insider threat detection workflow!** 🎉

## 🏆 System Now Fully Operational

All simulation buttons now work correctly:

- ✅ Login Threat Simulation
- ✅ Bulk Download Simulation
- ✅ Geographic Anomaly Simulation
- ✅ Real Employee Login

The system is ready for demonstration and further development!
