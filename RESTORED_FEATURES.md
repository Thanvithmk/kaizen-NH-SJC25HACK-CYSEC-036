## 📥 File Download Features

### Available Endpoints

#### 1. List All Files

```http
GET /api/files
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 10,
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "Confidential_Client_Data.csv",
      "size": 157286400,
      "sizeInMB": "150.00",
      "modified": "2025-10-29T12:00:00.000Z",
      "type": ".csv"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Download Single File

```http
GET /api/files/download/:filename?employee_token=EMP001
```

**What Happens**:

1. ✅ File is sent to user
2. ✅ Download activity logged in `BulkDownloadAlert`
3. ✅ Checks recent downloads (last 1 hour)
4. ✅ Creates `ActiveThreat` if risk detected
5. ✅ Emits real-time alert to dashboard
6. ✅ Triggers on:
   - File size > 100MB
   - 5+ files in 1 hour
   - Total size > 200MB in 1 hour
   - Risk score ≥ 30

**Example**:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/files/download/Confidential_Client_Data.csv?employee_token=EMP001"
```

#### 3. Bulk Download Multiple Files

```http
POST /api/files/bulk-download
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "employee_token": "EMP001",
  "filenames": [
    "Confidential_Client_Data.csv",
    "Payroll_Records_2024.xlsx",
    "Financial_Summary_2024.pdf"
  ]
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Bulk download logged",
  "alert_id": "...",
  "threat_id": "...",
  "risk_score": 65,
  "risk_level": "High"
}
```

## 🕐 Off-Hours Login Detection

### How It Works

When an employee logs in via `POST /api/employees/login`, the system:

1. **Validates credentials** (bcrypt password check)
2. **Creates LoginActivity** record
3. **Checks login time** against employee's usual hours
4. **Applies 1-hour buffer** (grace period)
5. **Calculates risk**:
   - **Normal hours**: Risk = 5 (Low)
   - **Off-hours**: Risk = 40 (Medium)
6. **Creates ActiveThreat** with appropriate severity
7. **Emits real-time alert** to dashboard

### Example Scenario

**Employee Pattern**:

```json
{
  "emp_token": "EMP001",
  "usual_login_time": "09:00",
  "usual_logout_time": "17:00"
}
```

**Allowed Login Times** (with buffer):

- ✅ 08:00 - 18:00 (Normal hours + 1 hour buffer)

**Off-Hours Examples**:

- ⚠️ 02:00 AM - Medium risk
- ⚠️ 22:00 PM - Medium risk
- ⚠️ 07:30 AM - Medium risk (before buffer)

### Login Flow

```
Employee logs in at 02:00 AM
    ↓
Password validated ✓
    ↓
LoginActivity created
    ↓
Check time: 02:00 vs 09:00-17:00
    ↓
OFF-HOURS DETECTED!
    ↓
ActiveThreat created:
  - risk_score: 40
  - severity_level: "Medium"
  - anomalies: ["Login outside usual hours: 02:00"]
  - is_off_hours: true
    ↓
Real-time alert emitted:
  "⚠️ Off-hours login: John Smith at 2:00"
    ↓
Dashboard updates instantly
```

## 🎯 Risk Score Calculation

### File Downloads

```javascript
Risk factors:
- File size > 500MB         → +40 points
- File size > 200MB         → +25 points
- 50+ files in 1 hour       → +30 points
- 30+ files in 1 hour       → +20 points
- Off-hours download        → +15 points
- Sensitive file types      → +10 points

Categories:
- High:   score ≥ 50
- Medium: 25 ≤ score < 50
- Low:    score < 25
```

### Off-Hours Login

```javascript
Normal hours:    Risk = 5  (Low)
Off-hours:       Risk = 40 (Medium)
```

### Dashboard Categories

The dashboard categorizes threats based on `risk_score`:

```javascript
// In dashboardRoutes.js
if (risk_score >= 50) → "High"
if (risk_score >= 25 && < 50) → "Medium"
if (risk_score < 25) → "Low"
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test File Download

1. **Start backend**: `cd backend && npm start`
2. **Login as employee**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/employees/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"employeeId":"EMP001","password":"password123"}'
   ```

3. **Download file**:

   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:5000/api/files/download/Confidential_Client_Data.csv?employee_token=EMP001" -o test.csv
   ```

4. **Check dashboard**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Should see new bulk download alert
   - Real-time notification should appear

### Test Off-Hours Login

**Option 1: Change Employee Pattern**

```javascript
// In MongoDB, update employee's usual hours
db.employeepatterns.updateOne(
  { emp_token: "EMP001" },
  {
    $set: {
      usual_login_time: "01:00",
      usual_logout_time: "03:00",
    },
  }
);

// Now login at current time (will be off-hours)
```

**Option 2: Wait for Off-Hours**

- Login outside 08:00-18:00
- System will detect and flag as Medium risk

   - Created for ALL successful logins (with appropriate risk)
   - Off-hours logins flagged as Medium

3. **LoginActivity**
   - Records all login attempts
   - Includes timestamp for off-hours detection
